No features beyond those required by the spec have been implemented.
Both scenes render the same as the reference image.

The normals on the water surface are not generated using the gradient of the
mathematical function that defines the surface. Instead, the normals are
computed by taking the face normal of each face adjacent to a vertex, and
averaging these together. This technique for normal generation would be useful
if the water surface function is ever changed.

Spheres are rendered using display lists. All spheres share a display list of
a unit icosphere. This icosphere is generated using the algorithm described 
on <http://www.sulaco.co.za/recursive_subdivision_tutorial.htm> and is mostly
transcribed to C++ from the original Delphi.
