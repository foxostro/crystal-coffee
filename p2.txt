Project 2

My P2 works perfectly.

Extensions:

1. Instead of using a lat/long sphere, I'm using a subdivided platonic solid.
These spheres have a consistent distribution of polygons across the surface of
the sphere, which -- besides being kinda cool -- prevents a common issue with
lat/long spheres where the poles have a large number of tiny, useless polygons.

Also, I'm generating tangents for the sphere and have included a bump-mapped
sphere as an additional scene in staffldr.

(See scenes 3 and 2.)

2. I've created a new shader "BumpyChrome" which combines the effects of the 
bump map shader with the environment mapping portion of the fresnel shader.

(See scenes 4 and 2.)
